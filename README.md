### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is Michael, and I'm a **data analyst** interested in using **statistics**, **data visualization**, and **programming** to solve real-world problems and contribute to valuable research.

- ðŸš— I recently completed an [analysis](https://github.com/michaeljhanley/sfo-survey-viz) of airport transportation survey data to identify behavioral patterns across traveler segments.
- ðŸ›« I'm currently working on an end-to-end data analysis [pipeline](https://github.com/michaeljhanley/flight-delay-analysis) processing 700K+ Alaska Airlines flight records to optimize departure scheduling at SeaTac Airport. 
- ðŸš€ I'm seeking opportunities in data analysis, survey research, or statistics-driven roles, where I can contribute my communication skills and analytical mindset to teams and projects that align with my values.
- ðŸ“¬ Message me at <michaelhanley11@gmail.com> and let's dive into some data together!
